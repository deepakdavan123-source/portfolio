        <h2>Role Of AI in Digital Marketing</h2>
        <p>
          AI is transforming digital marketing by helping businesses better understand their customers and improve their strategies. I use AI to analyze customer data, create personalized ads, and automate tasks like email marketing and social media management. AI-powered tools such as chatbots enhance customer support by providing instant feedback. By integrating AI, businesses can work more efficiently, reach the right audience, and boost sales, making digital marketing smarter and more effective.
